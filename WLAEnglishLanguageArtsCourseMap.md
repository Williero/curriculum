<span class="c14 c6 c25">Course Overview for ELA I</span>

<span class="c6 c25">The Washington Leadership Academy English Language
Arts Course is a multidimensional approach to ELA that provides students
with both leveled and grade-level appropriate reading with a mixture of
fiction and nonfiction reading. The curriculum is intended to develop
the core proficiencies laid out in the Common Core ELA State Standards.
The school has worked in partnership with Odell Education (OE)
(odelleducation.org) to adapt the 9th-grade Odell ELA curriculum to an
internally developed Canon for WLA. The Canon is comprised of text lists
for each interim that are coordinated to the topic studies being done
during that interim (see topic studies section in the school curriculum
overview). See a sample text set for the Evidence Based Argumentation
Module </span><span
class="c20 c29 c6">[here](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://odelleducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Argumentation-Text-Sets-G9.pdf&sa=D&ust=1471537488969000&usg=AFQjCNG9x1Xcdxf_zykA9VSv9tTHbMW_0A){.c72}</span><span
class="c6 c25">.</span>

<span class="c6 c25"></span>

<span class="c6 c25">The Odell curriculum model seeks to help students
gain the capacity to read texts closely for textual details; find,
understand, and make evidence-based claims; use texts to deepen
understanding through research; and use texts to generate evidence-based
arguments. Additionally the curriculum features a focus on creativity,
collaboration, investigation, pairing complex texts with multimedia, and
deep vocabulary development. See below for an overview of OE’s Design.
</span>

<span class="c51 c6"> </span>

<span class="c14 c6">Odell Education Overview of Design Features</span>

<span class="c51 c6"></span>

<span class="c14 c6">Common Core Alignment </span><span class="c6">Each
module focuses instruction and assessment on developing core
proficiencies aligned with a limited set of targeted standards.
Additionally, the activities of each module integrate many other
standards to support student learning. This two-tiered alignment design
builds a variety of literacy skills in an integrated way, while
developing core proficiencies through focused lesson sequences and
assessment. The design also helps teachers capture precise evidence of
student proficiency as they monitor student progress and integrate the
series into a yearlong instructional plan.</span>

<span class="c51 c6"> </span>

<span class="c14 c6">Creativity </span><span class="c6">Module
activities have been built to encourage creativity and leadership
development with the goal of empowering students with awareness and
responsibility of their own learning. The modules are strongly focused
on deep analysis of texts in ways that encourage the expression and
defense of personal thinking. Approaches to literacy focus on
independent questioning of texts, making one’s own claims about texts
and defending them with evidence, developing inquiry questions and
employing independent research to deepen understanding, and constructing
personal logical arguments to explain one’s perspective.</span>

<span class="c6 c51"> </span>

<span class="c14 c6">Collaboration and Independence </span><span
class="c6">Following the design and intent of the Common Core, the
module series incorporates sustained and structured collaborative
activities to build those essential collaborative skills and habits.
Equally important to literacy is the ability to handle tasks
independently. As such, the sequences of activities and materials in the
modules lead students progressively to successful independent
performance.</span>

<span class="c51 c6"> </span>

<span class="c14 c6">Engaging in Complex Texts </span><span
class="c6">The series is intentionally crafted around complex texts from
a range of contexts so that students have opportunities to engage with
significant ideas from a diversity of topics and perspectives, and
analyze, evaluate, and employ textual evidence across genres. The open
source and freely accessible texts also provide teachers with a rich
repository of common core-aligned reading material, most of which have
been formatted to include vocabulary glossing and line and paragraph
numbers.</span>

<span class="c6"> </span>

<span class="c14 c6">Multimedia and Technology </span><span
class="c6">Developing literacy with multimedia and technology are
critical to the curriculum. Students develop analytic reading and
research skills in various media. To support and encourage this
development, the module materials themselves have been designed to be
used electronically by teachers and students in their analysis, writing
and collaboration.</span>

<span class="c6"> </span>

<span class="c14 c6">Support for All Learners </span><span
class="c6">The sequence of instruction has been designed to engage all
students in instruction aligned to the CCSS.  The text choices in this
series combined with a purposeful sequence of instruction in each module
work together to bring ALL students, including ELL students and those
reading below grade level, into productive struggle with texts,
collaborative conversation, and evidence-based writing. Activities,
pedagogical notes, worksheets, and handouts have been designed to aid
the learning of diverse students.</span>

<span class="c6"> </span>

<span class="c14 c6">Vocabulary Development </span><span
class="c6">Instruction is designed to give students conceptual facility
with key literacy concepts and text-based expansion of vocabulary
building skills. Module texts also include modifiable glossaries of
infrequent vocabulary and concepts to support all readers including ELL
and those reading below grade-level.</span>

<span class="c14 c6">Instructional Model and Implementation Strategies
for ELA</span>

<span class="c6 c25">WLAs English Class will meet every day for ninety
minutes. Students will rotate on a block schedule where they will fully
engage in the OE curriculum using the text lists associated with that
interim’s topic study. The texts used will range within the appropriate
lexile-level for 9th-grade students. On the following day students will
go to the Literacy Studio class. The Literacy studio is a class where
students will complete a close reading of a leveled text in a personally
curated set of texts, based on a student’s reading level. The focus of
the reading is to ensure students gain capacity in argumentative and
claims-based writing and reading (see CERCA below). Each text is
associated with the interim topic study. Students will also conduct a
longer text study (full book) in small groups using a digitally hosted
text (see DAIR). The following strategies will be used to implement the
WLA model:</span>

<span class="c6 c25"></span>

<span class="c6 c17 c25">Curated Close Reading Playlists:</span><span
class="c6 c25"> During an interim students will engage in reading texts
that apply to the interim topic but are curated to varying lexile
levels. These texts will be set into a playlist of readings and
associated assignments that students will complete at their own
pace.</span>

<span class="c6 c25"></span>

<span class="c6 c17 c25">Curated Book Playlists: </span><span
class="c6 c25">Students will study a list of texts prescribed throughout
the year using a digital platform (see DAIR below), these texts will be
self-paced and used metametrics questioning models to assess students
comprehension of syntax, fluency, and vocabulary.</span>

<span class="c6 c25"></span>

<span class="c6 c17">Close Reading: </span><span class="c6">Students
will regularly engage in complex texts that require them to reread and
analyze texts to unlock meaning, inference, syntactical structure,
claims, reasoning, evidence, and audience. Close reads are instrumental
to the daily reading experiences of students across both ELA courses
(Odell and the Literacy studio). </span>

<span class="c6 c17"></span>

<span class="c6 c17">Pre-complex Text Studies: </span><span
class="c6">Text studies for each interim include a series of pre-complex
texts that are carefully sequenced from lower to higher lexile levels.
Students will use lower level texts to gain core knowledge around a
topic then take on texts that gradually grow in complexity. </span>

<span class="c6 c17"></span>

<span class="c6 c17">Non-Fiction Text and CERCAs: </span><span
class="c6">A CERCA is a full-cycle examination of a close read where
students investigate the (C)laim, (E)vidence, (R)easoning for (C)laims,
presented (C)ounterclaims, and the (A)udience of a complex text. The
instructional format is hosted using a digital platform from ThinkCERCA
(thinkcerca.com). Students practice argumentative writing around a close
read.  </span>

<span class="c6"></span>

<span class="c6 c17">Digitally Accountable Independent Reading
(DAIR):</span><span class="c6"> During the Literacy Studio time students
will read leveled books associated with the interim topic study. The
book will be hosted on digital platform such as LightSail where students
will be assessed for semantic, syntax, fluency, and other comprehension
items.</span>

<span class="c14 c6">Methods of Assessment for the ELA Course</span>

<span class="c6">Students will be assessed in a variety of methods
throughout the ELA course with assessments ranging in length, depth, and
style. Assessments in some cases will seek to emulate the PARCC
assessment and in other instances assess students’ abilities to apply
their skills in other environments. Below is a list of assessment types
for the ELA course:</span>

<span class="c6"></span>

<span class="c6 c17">Modular Assessments: </span><span class="c6">At the
completion of a module students will take a Modular assessment that
assesses the literacy skills specific to that module.</span>

<span class="c6"></span>

<span class="c6 c17">Interim Assessments: </span><span class="c6">At the
completion of every interim students will take interim assessments.
These assessments emulate PARCC-styled assessments and assess all
materials covered up to that point of the course. </span>

<span class="c6"></span>

<span class="c6 c17">Performance-based Assessments for PARCC Performance
Level Descriptors:</span><span class="c6"> Students will be assessed on
specific skills acquired throughout the year on skills prescribed by the
</span><span class="c20 c6 c29">[PARCC Performance Level Descriptors for
ELA](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.parcconline.org/assessments/test-design/ela-literacy/ela-performance-level-descriptors&sa=D&ust=1471537489018000&usg=AFQjCNGKShxmbQTCuceK4Q1L2zJDJaqpUw){.c72}</span><span
class="c6"> and detailed in the evidence table for each sub-claim.
</span><span class="c6">Assessments will be given when each student has
learned the concepts categorized within a sub-claim and use a variety of
texts to assess a student’s ability to under literary structure,
information, vocabulary of a text, and written expression. Below is a
sample sub-claim for the PARCC 9th-grade PLDs for written expression:

<span class="c6 c17">Project Artifacts and Exhibitions:</span><span
class="c6"> Throughout each interim students will be asked to
investigate a challenge or problem aligned to the interim topic and
complete a project that addresses the topic while also integrating
skills learned in each course. Each project will have a course-specific
artifact or exhibition that is assessed by the course
teacher</span><span class="c6">.</span>

Understanding</span>

<span class="c15 c6"> </span>

<span class="c15 c6"> </span>

<span class="c15 c6">This module lays out an inquiry process through
which students learn how to deepen their understanding of topics.
Students pose and refine inquiry questions, exploring areas they wish to
investigate. They find and assess sources and organize researched
material in ways that will support their analysis and integration of
information. As their inquiry progresses, they evaluate and extend their
research, synthesize their information, and eventually express their
evolving evidence-based perspective.</span>

Education (OE) recognizes the essential connections among teaching,
learning, and assessment. In addition to supporting educators with
curriculum and training, OE also provides design and technical
assistance in the creation of a range of assessments. OE will be
partnering with Washington Leadership Academy to pilot assessments that
align with the each module or modules if assess learning done in two
different modules. </span>

<span class="c6"> </span>

<span class="c14 c6">Formative Assessments</span><span
class="c6 c17"> </span><span class="c6">OE has developed a
comprehensive, criteria-based assessment system used throughout the Core
Proficiencies modules. As students move through increasingly complex
skill sets, they use literacy skills handouts to provide useful
background information about the skill they are acquiring or refining,
graphic organizers (tools) to form and refine specific literacy skills,
and criteria checklists to guide and evaluate written work.</span>

<span class="c6"> </span>

<span class="c6">Formative assessments opportunities come from the use
of graphic organizers such as annotation tools, tools to make claims
about texts, tools to delineate arguments and checklists to participate
effectively in text-based discussions. Teachers and students use
criteria-based checklists to evaluate written works such as evaluative
and comparative essays, and culminating classroom discussions.</span>

| <span class="c6">Making evidence based claims about texts is a core      |
| literacy and critical thinking proficiency that lies at the heart of     |
| CCSS. There are two parts to making evidence based claims. The first     |
| part is the ability to extract detailed information from texts and       |
| understand how the information is conveyed. In this case students will   |
| be examining texts and a variety of media. Instruction will push         |
| students beyond thematic understanding to a deep understanding of the    |
| textual context and the author’s craft. The second half of the skill is  |
| the ability to make valid claims about the new information thus gleaned. |
| Students will have to do more than restate information to create meaning |
| from the text. It is essential that students understand the importance   |
| and purpose of evidence-claims. </span>                                  |

| <span class="c15 c6">This module included both an understanding of       |
| Historical Narratives and Perspectives. Historical Narratives and        |
| Perspectives: The USS Jeannette’s 1879 Voyage to the North Pole develops |
| students’ understanding of historical narrative, primary and secondary   |
| sources, and author’s perspective. It then challenges students to        |
| research a historical event of their choice.  This research module       |
| develops that explorative proficiency: researching to deepen             |
| understanding. Through the process, students will engage in their        |
| learning community, pose and refine questions. They will listen to their |
| own experiences and discover areas to investigate. This will allow       |
| students to self assess what they do or do not know. The module will     |
| also develop and support students’ ability to archive and organize       |
| information in order to see and analyze connections in ways that both    |
| aid comprehension and evolve perspectives. </span>                       |

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| <span class="c6">This module is about teaching students to develop a     |
| “mental model” of what effective- and reasoned- argumentation entails to |
| guide them in reading, evaluating, and communicating arguments around    |
| issues to which there are more than two sides.  Overall students must    |
| learn: 1) to investigate and understand an issue 2) to develop an        |
| evidence-based perspective and position; 3) to evaluate and respond to   |
| the perspectives and positions of others; 4) to make, support, and link  |
| claims as premises in a logical chain of reasoning; and 5) to            |
| communicate a position so that others can understand thoughtfully        |
| evaluate thinking.  In the final module, students will begin by reading  |
| and analyzing William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. Through their      |
| study of this play, students analyze the various arguments presented in  |
| the play. They will examine the development and interaction of complex   |
| characters and multiple central ideas. Throughout the module, students   |
| engage in close reading, text annotation, and evidence-based discussion  |
| and writing. After analyzing argumentation through a fictional work,     |
| students will analyze evidence based argumentation through the events    |
| surrounding September 11</span><span class="c6 c70">th</span><span       |
| class="c15 c6">.  The overall module focuses on learning about and       |
| applying concepts communicated through terminology such as issue,        |
| perspective, position, premise, evidence, and reasoning. Thus, the       |
| module provides numerous opportunities to builds students’ academic      |
| vocabularies, while emphasizing close reading and research skills,       |
| critical thinking, evidence- based discussion, collaborative             |
| development, and iterative approach to writing. </span>                  |
