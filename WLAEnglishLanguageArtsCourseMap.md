***Course Overview for ELA I***

The Washington Leadership Academy English Language Arts Course is a
multidimensional approach to ELA that provides students with both
leveled and grade-level appropriate reading with a mixture of fiction
and nonfiction reading. The curriculum is intended to develop the core
proficiencies laid out in the Common Core ELA State Standards. The
school has worked in partnership with Odell Education (OE)
(odelleducation.org) to adapt the 9th-grade Odell ELA curriculum to an
internally developed Canon for WLA. The Canon is comprised of text lists
for each interim that are coordinated to the topic studies being done
during that interim (see topic studies section in the school curriculum
overview). See a sample text set for the Evidence Based Argumentation
Module
[*here*](http://odelleducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Argumentation-Text-Sets-G9.pdf).

The Odell curriculum model seeks to help students gain the capacity to
read texts closely for textual details; find, understand, and make
evidence-based claims; use texts to deepen understanding through
research; and use texts to generate evidence-based arguments.
Additionally the curriculum features a focus on creativity,
collaboration, investigation, pairing complex texts with multimedia, and
deep vocabulary development. See below for an overview of OE’s Design.

***Odell Education Overview of Design Features***

***Common Core Alignment*** Each module focuses instruction and
assessment on developing core proficiencies aligned with a limited set
of targeted standards. Additionally, the activities of each module
integrate many other standards to support student learning. This
two-tiered alignment design builds a variety of literacy skills in an
integrated way, while developing core proficiencies through focused
lesson sequences and assessment. The design also helps teachers capture
precise evidence of student proficiency as they monitor student progress
and integrate the series into a yearlong instructional plan.

***Creativity*** Module activities have been built to encourage
creativity and leadership development with the goal of empowering
students with awareness and responsibility of their own learning. The
modules are strongly focused on deep analysis of texts in ways that
encourage the expression and defense of personal thinking. Approaches to
literacy focus on independent questioning of texts, making one’s own
claims about texts and defending them with evidence, developing inquiry
questions and employing independent research to deepen understanding,
and constructing personal logical arguments to explain one’s
perspective.

***Collaboration and Independence*** Following the design and intent of
the Common Core, the module series incorporates sustained and structured
collaborative activities to build those essential collaborative skills
and habits. Equally important to literacy is the ability to handle tasks
independently. As such, the sequences of activities and materials in the
modules lead students progressively to successful independent
performance.

***Engaging in Complex Texts*** The series is intentionally crafted
around complex texts from a range of contexts so that students have
opportunities to engage with significant ideas from a diversity of
topics and perspectives, and analyze, evaluate, and employ textual
evidence across genres. The open source and freely accessible texts also
provide teachers with a rich repository of common core-aligned reading
material, most of which have been formatted to include vocabulary
glossing and line and paragraph numbers.

***Multimedia and Technology*** Developing literacy with multimedia and
technology are critical to the curriculum. Students develop analytic
reading and research skills in various media. To support and encourage
this development, the module materials themselves have been designed to
be used electronically by teachers and students in their analysis,
writing and collaboration.

***Support for All Learners*** The sequence of instruction has been
designed to engage all students in instruction aligned to the CCSS. The
text choices in this series combined with a purposeful sequence of
instruction in each module work together to bring ALL students,
including ELL students and those reading below grade level, into
productive struggle with texts, collaborative conversation, and
evidence-based writing. Activities, pedagogical notes, worksheets, and
handouts have been designed to aid the learning of diverse students.

***Vocabulary Development*** Instruction is designed to give students
conceptual facility with key literacy concepts and text-based expansion
of vocabulary building skills. Module texts also include modifiable
glossaries of infrequent vocabulary and concepts to support all readers
including ELL and those reading below grade-level.

***Instructional Model and Implementation Strategies for ELA***

WLAs English Class will meet every day for ninety minutes. Students will
rotate on a block schedule where they will fully engage in the OE
curriculum using the text lists associated with that interim’s topic
study. The texts used will range within the appropriate lexile-level for
9th-grade students. On the following day students will go to the
Literacy Studio class. The Literacy studio is a class where students
will complete a close reading of a leveled text in a personally curated
set of texts, based on a student’s reading level. The focus of the
reading is to ensure students gain capacity in argumentative and
claims-based writing and reading (see CERCA below). Each text is
associated with the interim topic study. Students will also conduct a
longer text study (full book) in small groups using a digitally hosted
text (see DAIR). The following strategies will be used to implement the
WLA model:

**Curated Close Reading Playlists:** During an interim students will
engage in reading texts that apply to the interim topic but are curated
to varying lexile levels. These texts will be set into a playlist of
readings and associated assignments that students will complete at their
own pace.

**Curated Book Playlists:** Students will study a list of texts
prescribed throughout the year using a digital platform (see DAIR
below), these texts will be self-paced and used metametrics questioning
models to assess students comprehension of syntax, fluency, and
vocabulary.

**Close Reading:** Students will regularly engage in complex texts that
require them to reread and analyze texts to unlock meaning, inference,
syntactical structure, claims, reasoning, evidence, and audience. Close
reads are instrumental to the daily reading experiences of students
across both ELA courses (Odell and the Literacy studio).

**Pre-complex Text Studies:** Text studies for each interim include a
series of pre-complex texts that are carefully sequenced from lower to
higher lexile levels. Students will use lower level texts to gain core
knowledge around a topic then take on texts that gradually grow in
complexity.

**Non-Fiction Text and CERCAs:** A CERCA is a full-cycle examination of
a close read where students investigate the (C)laim, (E)vidence,
(R)easoning for (C)laims, presented (C)ounterclaims, and the (A)udience
of a complex text. The instructional format is hosted using a digital
platform from ThinkCERCA (thinkcerca.com). Students practice
argumentative writing around a close read.

**Digitally Accountable Independent Reading (DAIR):** During the
Literacy Studio time students will read leveled books associated with
the interim topic study. The book will be hosted on digital platform
such as LightSail where students will be assessed for semantic, syntax,
fluency, and other comprehension items.

***Methods of Assessment for the ELA Course***

Students will be assessed in a variety of methods throughout the ELA
course with assessments ranging in length, depth, and style. Assessments
in some cases will seek to emulate the PARCC assessment and in other
instances assess students’ abilities to apply their skills in other
environments. Below is a list of assessment types for the ELA course:

**Modular Assessments:** At the completion of a module students will
take a Modular assessment that assesses the literacy skills specific to
that module.

**Interim Assessments:** At the completion of every interim students
will take interim assessments. These assessments emulate PARCC-styled
assessments and assess all materials covered up to that point of the
course.

**Performance-based Assessments for PARCC Performance Level
Descriptors:** Students will be assessed on specific skills acquired
throughout the year on skills prescribed by the [*PARCC Performance
Level Descriptors for
ELA*](http://www.parcconline.org/assessments/test-design/ela-literacy/ela-performance-level-descriptors)
and detailed in the evidence table for each sub-claim. Assessments will
be given when each student has learned the concepts categorized within a
sub-claim and use a variety of texts to assess a student’s ability to
under literary structure, information, vocabulary of a text, and written
expression. Below is a sample sub-claim for the PARCC 9th-grade PLDs for
written expression:

height="3.3438834208223973in"}

**Project Artifacts and Exhibitions:** Throughout each interim students
will be asked to investigate a challenge or problem aligned to the
interim topic and complete a project that addresses the topic while also
integrating skills learned in each course. Each project will have a
course-specific artifact or exhibition that is assessed by the course
teacher.

  ***Module 3: Researching to Deepen Understanding***   This module lays out an inquiry process through which students learn how to deepen their understanding of topics. Students pose and refine inquiry questions, exploring areas they wish to investigate. They find and assess sources and organize researched material in ways that will support their analysis and integration of information. As their inquiry progresses, they evaluate and extend their research, synthesize their information, and eventually express their evolving evidence-based perspective.   **Part 1. Initiating Inquiry:** Students learn the purposes and processes of using inquiry and research to deepen understanding. Students initiate inquiry on a topic through collaboratively generating questions to direct and frame research.

***Module Assessments***

***A Common Timeframe for Modules and Interim Assessments*** Odell
Education (OE) recognizes the essential connections among teaching,
learning, and assessment. In addition to supporting educators with
curriculum and training, OE also provides design and technical
assistance in the creation of a range of assessments. OE will be
partnering with Washington Leadership Academy to pilot assessments that
align with the each module or modules if assess learning done in two
different modules.

***Formative Assessments*** OE has developed a comprehensive,
criteria-based assessment system used throughout the Core Proficiencies
modules. As students move through increasingly complex skill sets, they
use literacy skills handouts to provide useful background information
about the skill they are acquiring or refining, graphic organizers
(tools) to form and refine specific literacy skills, and criteria
checklists to guide and evaluate written work.

Formative assessments opportunities come from the use of graphic
organizers such as annotation tools, tools to make claims about texts,
tools to delineate arguments and checklists to participate effectively
in text-based discussions. Teachers and students use criteria-based
checklists to evaluate written works such as evaluative and comparative
essays, and culminating classroom discussions.

***Summative Assessments*** Washington Leadership Academy will use
shared assessments throughout the academic year. Each interim session
will end with an interim assessment that covers the standards within
each course’s scope and sequence. Students will takefour interim
assessments throughout they year. Interim assessments will be given
during the last week of each interim session.

***Module \#1: Reading Closely for Textual Details***

  This module empowers students with critical reading and writing skills by having them engage with complex text to analyze textual details and deepen understanding. Students learn what it means to read a text closely by attending to and analyzing textual details. Students analyze visual-based texts. Furthermore, students learn to use questions to guide their approach to, reading, and deeper analysis of texts. Students read and analyze informational texts. Students will also learn to analyze textual detail as a key to discovering meaning by reading and comparing texts. Students will learn how to summarize and explain what they have learned from their reading, questioning, and analysis of texts. Overall, students read and analyze three related texts in both portions of the module. Lastly, students learn the characteristics of an effective text-based discussion and demonstrate skills in leading and participating in one.

***Module 2: Making Evidence Based Claims***

  Making evidence based claims about texts is a core literacy and critical thinking proficiency that lies at the heart of CCSS. There are two parts to making evidence based claims. The first part is the ability to extract detailed information from texts and understand how the information is conveyed. In this case students will be examining texts and a variety of media. Instruction will push students beyond thematic understanding to a deep understanding of the textual context and the author’s craft. The second half of the skill is the ability to make valid claims about the new information thus gleaned. Students will have to do more than restate information to create meaning from the text. It is essential that students understand the importance and purpose of evidence-claims.

***Module \#3: Researching to Deepen Understanding***

  This module included both an understanding of Historical Narratives and Perspectives. Historical Narratives and Perspectives: The USS Jeannette’s 1879 Voyage to the North Pole develops students’ understanding of historical narrative, primary and secondary sources, and author’s perspective. It then challenges students to research a historical event of their choice. This research module develops that explorative proficiency: researching to deepen understanding. Through the process, students will engage in their learning community, pose and refine questions. They will listen to their own experiences and discover areas to investigate. This will allow students to self assess what they do or do not know. The module will also develop and support students’ ability to archive and organize information in order to see and analyze connections in ways that both aid comprehension and evolve perspectives.

***Module \#4: Building Evidence- Based Arguments***

  This module is about teaching students to develop a “mental model” of what effective- and reasoned- argumentation entails to guide them in reading, evaluating, and communicating arguments around issues to which there are more than two sides. Overall students must learn: 1) to investigate and understand an issue 2) to develop an evidence-based perspective and position; 3) to evaluate and respond to the perspectives and positions of others; 4) to make, support, and link claims as premises in a logical chain of reasoning; and 5) to communicate a position so that others can understand thoughtfully evaluate thinking. In the final module, students will begin by reading and analyzing William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. Through their study of this play, students analyze the various arguments presented in the play. They will examine the development and interaction of complex characters and multiple central ideas. Throughout the module, students engage in close reading, text annotation, and evidence-based discussion and writing. After analyzing argumentation through a fictional work, students will analyze evidence based argumentation through the events surrounding September 11^th^. The overall module focuses on learning about and applying concepts communicated through terminology such as issue, perspective, position, premise, evidence, and reasoning. Thus, the module provides numerous opportunities to builds students’ academic vocabularies, while emphasizing close reading and research skills, critical thinking, evidence- based discussion, collaborative development, and iterative approach to writing.
